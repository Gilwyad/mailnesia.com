#description List of alternative domain names

This is the current list of available alternative domain names.  Some
important notes first:

 - They can be used for one year, after which they will expire and no longer accept emails.
   The current expiry date is around the 29th of November each year.
 - You can always use your own domain name too, just follow the
   instructions on the [features](/features.html) page.
 - If you have an idea for a domain name please
   [send me](/contact.html) the name so I can buy it.

So the rule of thumb is, if you plan to use an email for years, use
@mailnesia.com, if you just need a quick address then forget about it,
use these alternate names.

 - dup.lol
 - legit-subscription.store
