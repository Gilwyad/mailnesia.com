#title Translation
#description Information about the translation of the site.

If the site is not available in your native language, you can
contribute with a translation - it will be greatly appreciated !

The process is fairly simple, there is a [Google Docs spreadsheet][spreadsheet]
with all the messages, words and pages in the available languages, you
just have to make a new column with your language.  Or if the
translation is already started in your language, just fill in the
missing cells.  Also, if you feel that a translation is inaccurate,
just replace the cell with a better version.  You can contribute with
a single phrase or whole pages, it's up to you!

Some notes to take into account:

* When adding a new language you should use the
  [IETF language tag][IETF] which is in the simplest case just the
  [ISO 639-1 two letter language code][ISO6391] (not a country code!).
  If you want to specify not just the language but the region as well
  (for example Canadian French or Argentinian Spanish), you should use
  two letter region codes from [ISO 3166-1][ISO31661] and combine the
  two codes with a hyphen:

    - Canadian French: fr-ca
    - Argentinian Spanish: es-ar

* In the spreadsheet the expressions `_x` and `_y` will be replaced by
  something, it can be figured out from the context. For example,
  `page _x` it will be the page number, `Mail for _y:` will be the
  mailbox name you enter in the form etc.  The `§` character is a text
  separator.

* In the translation spreadsheet you can use markdown formatting!  The
  syntax documentation is available on their official [website] [markdown-web].

* If you translate a whole column or page, you have a place on the
  [Thanks to](/thanksto.html) hall of fame, along with a link to your
  website (if you [send](/contact.html) your name and/or the URL after
  the translation).

* On the mailnesia\_translation page in the language\_selection row
  you should not translate the literal phrase "in English" but instead
  use the name of your language.  For example in French you write "in
  French" translated to French: "En Français".
